### Built for the T9Hacks Data Visualization/Humanitarian Track

The Boulder Crime Explorer is an interactive tool for visualizing crime in the Boulder area. It was created as part of [T9 Hacks](http://t9hacks.org), a hackathon on the CU Boulder campus. The team decided to create the tool as a combination of the Creative and Humanitarian Technology challenges. Our goal is to help citizens and public officials better understand crime in our community. The dataset we used is provided as part of the [Boulder Open Data Catalog](https://bouldercolorado.gov/open-data). All of our code is open source and licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/BoulderCrimeData/BoulderCrimeData/blob/master/LICENSE) on Github.
